Here you will find a collection of self made python and bash scripts
that i use regularly for various automated and manual shell tasks.

For better integration, my ~/.bashrc is configured to load the scripts
directory in the $PATH environment variable.
(a.k.a. export PATH = "$HOME/dev/scripts: $PATH")
